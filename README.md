### History behind the project
Back in 2011 when I created my first **modern** looking resume using Microsoft Word, I put in a lot of effort to make it stand out. When I wanted to re-use the same, Microsoft Word had changed enough to literally render it useless to be edited. So I started working out on building a new one using Web Technologies which would feed in data from a `json` file. The idea is to ensure that as long as I can make the edits in the `json` file I should be able to re-use this work.

### Why Open-Source?
As a ardent Open Source follower, I strongly believe that things can be made better together.
